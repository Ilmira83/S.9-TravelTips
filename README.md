# TravelTips

I’ve created a platform where travelers from around the world can no only share their stories, experiences, and valuable tips.
But also they will find a special user-friendly feature ещ build their own journey!
Just like shopping - add to your plans the daily adventures shared by other travelers.

So at the end you will have the ready-to-go Plan with blocks:
 - destination,
 - Journey Timeline,
 - notes with important reminders and small tips.

The project is built with Angular CLI 19, leveraging the latest built-in reactive primitives — signals — introduced in Angular 16 and enhanced in later versions. Signals are used for state management and reactive UI updates.

And also the latest httpResource feature was used for API GET requests, which simplifies data fetching and provides automatic caching and reactive updates out of the box.

## Features/Technologies:

- Dynamic Angular 19.2.0 routing with lazy loading

- Angular Signals for fine-grained reactive state management

- New Angular `httpResource` for streamlined and efficient API GET requests

- Reactive forms for CRUD fulfilment

- Node.js + MySql2(v.3.14.0) + Sequelize(v.6.37.7) + Express(v.5.1.0)

- Bootstrap/Bootswatch 5.3.5 for responding and fine design
